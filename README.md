## About the meetup
**SYNOPSIS** <br>
Dr. Stephanie Hicks will talk about design thinking – the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a data analysis product is being designed – and how the choices a data analyst makes affect the experience of the consumer.

**Title**: Design Principles for Data Analysis <br>
**Abstract**: The data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data analysis. While much has been written about statistical thinking, a complementary form of thinking that appears in the practice of data analysis is design thinking -- the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a solution is being designed. For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst (or producer of a data analysis) constructs, creates, or designs a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. These choices can affect the data analysis products themselves and the experience of the consumer of the data analysis. Therefore, the role of a producer can be thought of as designing the data analysis with a set of design principles. Here, we introduce design principles for data analysis and discuss some case studies where they were used in the classroom to characterize data analyses.
